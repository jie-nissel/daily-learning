Thoughts of Data Science Solution Architecture

Big Data Platform/Engine
* Apache Spark vs Hadoop: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hadoop-and-spark/ 
  Transformations: 
  Actions: 
  Map: 
  flatMap: 
  partition of an RDD or a dataframe: 
  file formats in spark: 
* Advantages of using spark and a file system as your data warehouse compared with Netezza or Vertica. 

Data Engineering 
* Wrote data pipelines in python 
* Architect a functional end to end data analytics backend 
* How to chooose to store the data? 
* databases/data stores: 
* Store data in the cloud bigquery, S3 or traditional SQL-based RDBMS: 
* Tradeoffs: scalability; cost efficient; 
* OLAP vs OLTP 
* Synchronous or async? 
* Push or pull model? 
* Importance of idempotency: 


SQL 
* join methods 
* SQL performance: explain; indexing
* SQL concepts
  * correlated vs non-correlated sub-query 
  * SQL analytic windon functions
  * Rank() vs Dense_rank()
  * SQL vs NoSQL
  * OLTP vs OLAP systems

Data Science Solution Development 
* Evaluation metric(s) and requirements 
* Train / Test
